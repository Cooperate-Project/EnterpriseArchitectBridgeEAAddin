# IncrementalDBSync

This is an Add-in for Enterprise Architect. It enables automatic refreshing of changes in the database by repeatedly polling logging tables.
These logging tables can be created by using a generator like [IncrementalDBSyncUtils](https://github.com/Cooperate-Project/IncrementalDBSyncUtils).

##Usage

To use this addin, first, use a active database and prepare it with triggers and logging tables, e.g. generated by [IncrementalDBSyncUtils](https://github.com/Cooperate-Project/IncrementalDBSyncUtils).
Then follow the steps described in the wiki to build and enable the add-in.
